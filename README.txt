This file serves as a guide to describe the content of this assignment.


We were given 5 labs to complete as well as an assignment (Homework 2).

The labs and their descriptions are as follow:



Lab 6.17 - Password Modifier

In this lab we were instructed to create a password modifier  program that will take a simple password and make it a stronger password - one thats hard to guess.

The screnario is as follow:

Many user-created passwords are simple and easy to guess. Write a program that takes a simple password and makes it stronger by replacing characters using the key below, and by appending "q*s" to the end of the input string.

Lab 6.22 - Brute force equation solver

In this lab we were instructed write a program that uses brute force to find an integer solution. 

The scenario is as follow:

Numerous engineering and scientific applications require finding solutions to a set of equations. Ex: 8x + 7y = 38 and 3x - 5y = -1 have a solution x = 3, y = 2. Given integer coefficients of two linear equations with variables x and y, use brute force to find an integer solution for x and y in the range -10 to 10.

Lab 7.25 - Calculate exact change

In lab 7.25 we were instructed to write a program that caclulate the exact change.

The scenario is as follow:

Write a program with total change amount as an integer input that outputs the change using the fewest coins, one coin type per line. The coin types are dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Use singular and plural coin names as appropriate, like 1 penny vs. 2 pennies.

************END OF Lab 7.25 *************

Lab 8.10 - Palindrome

In this lab we were instructed to write  a program whose input is a word or phrase and output whether the input is a palindrome.

The scenarrio is as follow:

A palindrome is a word or a phrase that is the same when read both forward and backward. Examples are: "bob," "sees," or "never odd or even" (ignoring spaces). Write a program whose input is a word or phrase, and that outputs whether the input is a palindrome.

************END OF Lab 8.10 *************


Lab 9.10 - Word frequencies (lists)

In this lab we were given an input file "input1.csv' and instructed to create a program that import the file, reads the file, and output the word frequencies.

The scenario is as follow:

Write a program that first reads in the name of an input file and then reads the file using the csv.reader() method. The file contains a list of words separated by commas. Your program should output the words and their frequencies (the number of times each word appears in the file) without any duplicates.

You will need to import the csv module.

Homework 2 - Perform simple file and mathematical operations.

In this assignment we were instructed to write a program that reads an imported file "inputDates.txt and output the results in a new file called "parsedDates.txt".

The Scenario is as follow:

Write a basic program that performs simple file and mathematical
operations.

A. Write a program that reads dates from input, one date per line. Each
date's format must be as follows: March 1, 1990. Any date not following
that format is incorrect and should be ignored. Use the find() method to
parse the string and extract the date. The input ends with -1 on a line
alone. Output each correct date as: 3/1/1990.

B. After the program is working as above, modify the program so that it
reads all dates from an input file “inputDates.txt” (an Example file is
attached).

C. Modify your program further so that after parsing all dates from the
input file “inputDates.txt”, it writes out the correct ones into an
output file called: “parsedDates.txt”.

Ex: If the input is:
--
March 1, 1990
April 2 1995
7/15/20
December 13, 2003
-1
--
then the output is:
--
3/1/1990
12/13/2003
